# Globetrotter AI: Your Personal AI Travel Planner

## ‚úàÔ∏è AI-Powered Taste-Based Travel Planning

Globetrotter AI is your personal AI-powered travel planner that uses **semantic search** and **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** to craft bespoke itineraries based on your unique taste profile. Simply tell us what you love - like "I love BTS, Studio Ghibli, and ramen" - and we'll create a personalized travel experience with interactive 3D map visualizations.

## ‚ú® Inspiration

The inspiration behind Globetrotter AI stems from the desire to transform travel planning from generic recommendations to truly personalized experiences. By understanding your unique taste profile through AI, we create trips that align with your interests, hobbies, and cultural preferences.

## üöÄ What it does

Globetrotter AI revolutionizes travel planning through:

1. **Taste Profile Analysis**: Using Google's Gemini AI to parse your interests and preferences
2. **Semantic Recommendations**: Leveraging Qloo's Taste API to find destinations, restaurants, and experiences aligned with your unique taste
3. **RAG-Powered Itineraries**: Combining AI reasoning with taste-aligned data to generate comprehensive, personalized day-by-day itineraries
4. **3D Journey Visualization**: Interactive 3D maps with cinematic animations to preview your adventure

## üõ†Ô∏è How we built it

### Frontend Architecture
- **React** and **TypeScript** for a robust, type-safe user interface
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and responsive design
- **Google Maps API** with advanced 3D visualizations and cinematic camera movements
- **Lucide React** for modern, crisp iconography

### Backend & AI Integration
- **Node.js/Express** backend with RESTful API design
- **Google Gemini AI** for natural language processing and RAG-powered itinerary generation
- **Qloo Taste API** for semantic recommendations based on cultural preferences
